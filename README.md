# TemplarsBot
Farming and resource collector for Dofus 2

## Historial
14/01/22: It is required that bot can work on any computer, the idea is to use with a VirtualMachine and let it running in second plane when the user can stay doing other thing.
Previously, I used SCAR DIVI, a software where you can write your script in PERL and it has a lot of useful functions to automate task in videogames. The reason that we don't use this program is because it is old and we intend to create a software that anybody easily can use it without download another software.
This bot will Python automation libraries like PYAUTOGUI, MOUSE, KEYBOARD. With PYAUTOGUI we expect to make the 90% of the bot, but it can't detect when a key is pressed. The solution is use MOUSE and KEYBOARD that is useful for a easy handling of mouse and keyboard functions like click or press/release some button.
